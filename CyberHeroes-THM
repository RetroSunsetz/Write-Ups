I use "curl -i webpage.com" to examine the source code whenever I want to enumerate a web server, and this time I discovered credentials there.
However, reversing a string is possible with the function Reversestring().
Reversestring(Hello), for instance, returns "olleH". 
Username wasn't reversed around. But because the password was reversed, all I had to do was rearrange it to gain access.
